DarkSkySharp is a C# library for accessing data from the near-term weather prediction system Dark Sky. It currently implements v1 of the draft API.

DarkSkySharp is not written by the Dark Sky authors, but you can find out more about their amazing system and app at http://darkskyapp.com/ . Sign up for their newsletter, so you can grab the iPhone app when it's released!

Use of DarkSkySharp requires an API key form Dark Sky. If you have a key, you can put it in the API class in DarkSky.cs, compile, and you're good to go.
